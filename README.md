## Instructions 
#
The acceptance  criteria of the application was to create an application that:

* Prompts the user for a password length bwetween 10-64 characters when the generate password button is clicked.
* Alert the user to try again is a number below 10 or above 64 is entered.
* Ask the user to confirm if the following character types should be included:
- Special Characters
- Numeric Characters
- Lowercase Characters
- Uppercase Characters
* Once the user has made their final selection an alert is shown followed by their password written on the page.

#

#

### Additional 

* In order to restrict the user from entering a string value in the password length field I included "isNaN" as part of the error alert.
